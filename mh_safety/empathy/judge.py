"""Empathy judge: rubric, JSON schema, and prompt builder.

Two variants of the rubric/schema are kept: the default one used by the
Anthropic backend, and a `_COMPACT` one used by the local Ollama backend, which
constrains the output so small local models reliably return valid, short JSON.
`spec(backend)` selects the right pair; the exact text/schema are preserved so
existing on-disk caches keep matching.
